# Udacity-FE-4x4 Matching Game
4x4 memory game based on the game Concentration. Project for Udacity Front End Nano Degree.

## How to open and play

This was one of my first projects and i messed up while uploading the repo and it is now nested inside of an additional folder.
However the proccess required to play the game is almost the same.
Download/clone repo, open Front End Project - Memory Game folder, inside is an index.html and another README.md,
read the other README.md and open index.html to play game.
